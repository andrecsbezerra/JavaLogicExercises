# 🚀 Programming Exercises Project

Welcome to the Programming Exercises Project! This repository contains a collection of algorithms and exercises implemented in Java. Below is a list of topics and concepts covered in this project.

## 📚 Topics and Concepts

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations** ➕ ➖
    - Implemented algorithms for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **Conditional Statements** ❓
    - Used `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to control the flow of the program based on conditions.

3. **Loops** 🔄
    - Utilized `for` and `while` loops to perform repetitive tasks, such as generating multiplication tables.

4. **Input and Output** 🖥️
    - Used `Scanner` for user input and `System.out.println` for outputting results to the console.

5. **Data Types and Variables** 📊
    - Worked with various data types (int, double, boolean) and declared variables to store values.

6. **Functions and Methods** 🛠️
    - Created reusable methods to encapsulate logic and improve code organization.

7. **Arrays** 📏
    - Implemented algorithms that utilize arrays to store and manipulate collections of data.

8. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** 🏛️
    - Applied OOP principles such as encapsulation and abstraction in the design of classes and objects.

9. **Error Handling** ⚠️
    - Implemented basic error handling to manage exceptions and ensure program stability.

10. **File Management** 📁
    - Managed project files and utilized `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files from version control.

11. **Version Control with Git** 🗂️
    - Used Git for version control, including branching, committing, and pushing changes to GitHub.

12. **Conventional Commits** ✅
    - Followed the Conventional Commits specification for clear and structured commit messages.
